# Skin Contact Menu

This project has become a new business tool for my current employer Skin Contact Wine Bar.

The python code uses a Bootstrap template file plus the most up to date Skin Contact wine and food menu (created in a Google Doc) downloaded as a text file, and outputs an HTML file incorporating the two.

Currently, I am learning how to post custom code on their WordPress site.
